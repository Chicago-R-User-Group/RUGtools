From the inaugural conference in 2009, the annual R/Finance conference in Chicago has become the primary meeting for academics and practitioners interested in using R in Finance. Participants from academia and industry mingle for two days to exchange ideas about current research, best practices and applications.

The best part is, it takes place right in our backyard!
